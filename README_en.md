# OpenWrt DFS Checker

[中文版](README.md)

## Introduction

This code was originally inspired by a response on Reddit: [DFS Radar Causes 5GHz to Drop and It Doesn't Come Back](https://www.reddit.com/r/openwrt/comments/rs9pit/dfs_radar_causes_5ghz_to_drop_and_it_doesnt_come/). I would like to extend my gratitude to `u/_daphreak_` and `u/try_harder_later` for their initial efforts.

I have made interactive modifications to this code using DeepSeek-R1-Lite, and the git history reflects the changes made during the process. I am quite satisfied with the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1-Lite.
